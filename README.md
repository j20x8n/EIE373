Laboratory Exercise 3: AVR Interrupt Programming
Objective: To develop C programs with interrupts under the Arduino platform.
Equipment: Atmel   Studio and the Arduino   Starter Kit
Procedure:
Section   A:   Write a single   C   program to implement two applications in Lab 2.Implement Sections B and C of   Lab 2 in the ArduinoUno so that two applications (traffic light   and   counting)   can   be   executed   at   the   same   time.   Note   that   CTC   mode   should   be   used.   The   clock   frequency   of the   Arduino   Start   Kit   is    16   MHz.   Note   that   you   should   write   a   simple   application   (e.g., flash one LED only) to   check   whether   you   can   set   a   timer   properly   by   using   an interrupt.
Important information:
You    must    use    interrupts      to      implement      these      two      applications      (i.e.,      timer      and      counter-   programming). Polling in timer programming is not accepted.

代做程序编程语言pplication by using an external hardware interrupt.
In   Section   A,   counter   programming   is   used   to   implement   the   application.   In   this   section,   an   external hardware interrupt INT0 is used as a counter to   implement   the   same   application.
Section   C:   Use an external hardware interrupt to enable the simulation of   the   traffic   lights.Connect   a   switch   to   an   external   hardware   interrupt   INT1   pin.   Write   a   C   program   so   that   the   traffic light simulation can   be started   by   pressing the switch once. If   the switch is   pressed again,   the simulation will be stopped (i.e., all   LEDs will   be   OFF).
Demonstrate   your   applications   in   Sections   A,B, and   C   to   our   student   helpers.
Instructions:
1.       You are required to demonstrate your   programs to our student helpers.
2.       Zip   all   programs   (including   the   whole   project)   in   Sections   A,   B,   and   C   into   a   single   file.   Submit it to Blackboard.
3.       Deadline: Check the course information.
